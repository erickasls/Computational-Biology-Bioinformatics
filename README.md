First problem set dealt with identifying the protein sequences that are associated with familial and sporadic cases of ALS.   There were data fasta files provided with the DNA gene sequences of the patients. List of lists was created in order to know the coding sequence intervals.

The miniproject file a two-month long project I worked with a team of 3 other students. We chose to worked with samples of patients with sporadic Parkinson's Disease. My part of the project was focused on identifying the differentially expressed genes between three different conditions. I performed hypothesis testing in the RNA seq-dataset such as Log2 fold chain and t-tests. All used with Python and clustermap was significant in order to view which genes were most expressed.
